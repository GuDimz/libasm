## Instructions.

The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.

## Introduction.

An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is a low-level programming language for a computer, or other programmable device, in which there is a very strong (but often not one-to-one) correspondence between the language and the architectureâ€™s machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture. In contrast, most high-level programming languages are generally portable across multiple architectures but require interpreting or compiling. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

## How to use?

`make`

## How to use test?

`make test`

## Good Luck!
